) Hi there, I’m Kamyar 👋
I’m a Software Engineer and Economist pivoting into Human‑Centered Data Science (HCDS), currently based in Toronto. I work at the intersection of algorithmic logic, markets, and human behavior, with a focus on building data products that respect real people, not فقط متریک‌ها.
What I’m working on
•	🛰️ Stealth‑mode mobile platform that uses behavioral economics and data science to help people make better resource decisions.
•	🧠 Reviving and upgrading my fundamentals in Python for Data Science and Machine Learning (end‑to‑end: data cleaning → modeling → interpretation).
•	📊 Exploring open‑source data visualization and behavioral data projects, especially around consumer behavior and financial decision‑making.
Interests
•	Human‑Centered Data Science (HCDS) & responsible AI
•	Behavioral economics, consumer behavior, and decision sciences
•	Data products that bridge the gap between what is technically possible and what is humanly right
Tech stack
•	Languages & Tools: Python · SQL · Jupyter
•	Data & ML: Pandas · NumPy · Scikit‑learn · A/B Testing
•	Visualization & Apps: Power BI · React Native (learning)
I’m open to collaborating on data‑driven projects that sit at the crossroads of data science, markets, and human behavior—especially if they can grow into real products or strong portfolio pieces.
