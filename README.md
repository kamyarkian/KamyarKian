Hi there, I’m Kamyar 👋
I’m a Software Engineer and Economist pivoting into Human‑Centered Data Science (HCDS). Based in Toronto, I work at the intersection of data, markets, and human behavior, turning noisy real‑world signals into actionable, ethical insights.
•	🧠 Currently building a stealth‑mode mobile platform that uses behavioral economics to help people make better resource decisions.
•	📊 Sharpening my fundamentals in Python for Data Science and Machine Learning (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit‑learn, SQL, Jupyter).
•	🤝 Open to collaborating on open‑source projects in data visualization, behavioral data, and responsible AI.
Tech stack: Python -  Pandas -  NumPy -  Scikit‑learn -  SQL -  Power BI -  Jupyter -  React Native (learning)
