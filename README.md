# Hi there, I'm Kamyar 👋

I am a **Software Engineer** and **Economist** working at the nexus of technology, market dynamics, and human behavior.

My focus is **Human-Centered Data Science (HCDS)**—bridging the gap between quantitative algorithms and the qualitative reality of human decision-making. I build systems that don't just process data, but respect the context behind it.

## 🔭 Current Focus & HCDS Portfolio

* **[Toronto Shelter Capacity Audit (2024)](https://github.com/kamyarkian/toronto-shelter-hcds-analysis):** conducted a quantitative audit of the city's shelter system using Python. 
    * *Key Finding:* Revealed systemic saturation (>99% occupancy) in Women's and Youth sectors, highlighting the ethical risks of zero-margin resource allocation.
* **Behavioral Economics & AI:** Exploring how algorithmic transparency can influence personal resource allocation (The Stealth Project).
* **Civic Tech:** Using open data to visualize "invisible" social infrastructure strains.

## 🛠 Tech & Tools

* **Core:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL
* **HCDS Analysis:** Probabilistic Reasoning, Algorithmic Auditing
* **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks, Power BI
* **Development:** React Native (Mobile), Git

🌱 *Open to collaborations on projects exploring Data Ethics, Behavioral Science, and Civic Tech.*
