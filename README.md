# Hi there, I’m Kamyar 👋

I am a **Software Engineer** and **Economist** working at the nexus of technology, market dynamics, and human behavior. 

My focus is **Human-Centered Data Science (HCDS)**—bridging the gap between quantitative algorithms and the qualitative reality of human decision-making. I build systems that don't just process data, but respect the context behind it.

### 🔭 Current Focus
* **The Stealth Project:** Architecting a mobile platform leveraging **Behavioral Economics** to optimize personal resource allocation (building with React Native & Python).
* **Data & Decisions:** Applying computational methods to uncover patterns in economic behavior using the PyData stack.
* **Ethics in AI:** Exploring frameworks for responsible data usage and algorithmic transparency.

### 🛠 Tech & Tools
* **Core:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* **Data Strategy:** SQL, Behavioral Data Analysis
* **Visualization:** Power BI, Jupyter
* **Development:** React Native (Mobile), Git

🌱 *Open to collaborations on projects exploring Data Ethics, Behavioral Science, and Civic Tech.*
